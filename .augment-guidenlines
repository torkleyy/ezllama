- write simple, elegant, efficient code
- don't use dependencies if you can easily avoid it
- don't overengineer stuff - don't make object-oriented structs unless it helps the readability
- write comments and documentation, not to repeat yourself, but to explain the intent of the code
- this should be done by researching how (non-explanatory) functions work and then commenting the piece of information that is required (because intuitive understanding fails)
